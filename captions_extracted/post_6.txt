The Canadian Engineering Leadership Conference (CELC) is the largest annual student run conference offered by the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES) and is the perfect way for engineering students from across the country to ring in the new year! CELC has two primary objectives. The first is that it provides a premier platform for students like you to engage, collaborate, and forge connections with industry leaders, sponsors, and engineering students from across Canada. This opportunity to form shared experiences and genuine connections with students that go through the same pains as you, with professionals who can help you, and with like-minded and similarly driven people is invaluable, as it provides tangible, real-life examples and advice on how to improve your personal and professional skills, engineering societies and faculty as a whole. The second objective is that it serves as the CFES annual general meeting and election, where the new CFES executive team will be elected. This allows you to either get involved on a national level through seeing what the CFES is all about or to learn what it means to be the Engineering Studentsâ€™ Society (ESS) next VP External Relations. 

CELC boasts a wide range of speakers and topics ranging from professional presentations from our sponsors and industry partners to student-led round-tables and panels that dissect the finer points of running student organizations.

The CFES strongly believes that CELC is an incredible opportunity for engineering students to expand their learning beyond the classroom and to provide the maximum possible benefit to yourself, your Engineering Student Organization and your Engineering Faculty.
